# Works-On-MNIST-Dataset
**different machine learning works on MNIST dataset**
- cnn clasifier: train a convolutional neural network to reduce the dimentions and then cusing clasifers.
- bayesian clasifier : find the distribution of the pixels in the different numbers.
- Autoencoder : create an Autoencoder to get a noisy image as input and denoise it in the output.
