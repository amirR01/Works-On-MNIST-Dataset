This repository contains different works on MNIST dataset.

- CNN clasifier:

 Train a convolutional neural network to reduce the dimentions of the images and classify them.

- Bayesian clasifier : 

Find the distribution of the pixels in the different numbers.

- Autoencoder :

 Create an Autoencoder to get a noisy image as input and denoise it in the output.
